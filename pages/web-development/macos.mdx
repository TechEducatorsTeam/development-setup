# MacOS Ventura+

You'll need to have the latest MacOS edition. Which at time of writing is
Sequoia.

Unless it’s already in your Dock, the easiest way to open Terminal (which
you’ll have to do often) is by launching Spotlight Search with `Cmd + Space`,
and typing `term`. You should then be able to hit the enter key to launch it.
Once it’s running, drag the Dock icon to the left to keep it in your Dock,
even after it’s closed.
