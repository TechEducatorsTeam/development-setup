# Install XCode development tools

In order to get a few of the tools you will need to download and use the web
development tools described in this document you will first need to download
the Apple's XCode Development Tools.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Install XCode

Open the terminal and type:

```sh copy
xcode-select --install
```

{" "}
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The developer tools are ~3GB in size. So this process will take approximately
  10mins on an average internet connection.
</Callout>

You can confirm the tool we require has been installed by running:

```sh copy
git --version
```

You should see the following output (correct at time of writing):

```
git version 2.39.2 (Apple Git-143)
```

We can now use `git` to install the rest of the software we will require.

### Step 2: Configure Git

Throughout the course we will be using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to keep
track of our work and publishing it to a VCS provider. During the course we
will use Github - a free VCS provider owned by Microsoft. Don't worry, we'll
give you an introduction into how to use it and will concentrate on getting
setup and configured today.

```sh copy
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
```

```sh copy
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

{" "}
<Callout emoji="💡">
  Make sure `'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'` in the command above matches the one you're
  using with GitHub.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Generate your SSH keys

Now, we'll create credentials for your git client and provide these to GitHub.
We'll generate a pair of "[SSH Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)"
We refer to one as your public key, and the other as your private key.

First, let's generate your new keys; at your terminal please type:

```sh copy
ssh-keygen
```

{" "}
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You will be asked for a file name, unless you need multiple keys the default
  name of `id_rsa` is appropriate.
</Callout>

{" "}
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You will be asked for a passphrase, we recommend leaving this empty and
  instead ensure you keep the private key safe.
</Callout>

You should see a similar output in your terminal as below:

```txt {5-6}
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:sk4MR4/BBLy2cXd0fSKqQdjqSfkVkQjz+NLSXyE+sy0 username@Computer-Host-Name
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   ...++ ..o .   |
|    .o.++ + o o .|
|     .=+...+.. o |
|    +.=Bo.+. .   |
|   ..**+S=+ .    |
|    .+o=o. *     |
|      +   E .    |
|     o     .     |
|      .          |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

This has created a public and private key in the `/home/username/.ssh`
directory, called `id_rsa` & `id_rsa.pub`. Keep the private key safe. We can
share the public key `id_rsa.pub` with GitHub or another provider. First let's
print out it's contents:

```sh copy
cat /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

You should see a similar output in your terminal as below:

```sh wrap
ssh-rsa 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 username@Computer-Host-Name
```

Copy this output and add it to your GitHub SSH Keys,
[Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)
The key's title is for your own benefit, allowing you to easily identify
different keys; we recommend naming it after your computer and generating new
keys on each device you use:

![Add your SSH keys to GitHub](/github--ssh-keys.jpg)

### Step 4: Confirm it's setup

Now, we can confirm this has worked by asking GitHub who it thinks you are:

```sh copy
ssh git@github.com
```

You will be asked to confirm the authenticity, simply type yes, and you should
see a message confirming "You've successfully authenticated":

```txt {7-8}
The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.3)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Hi TechEducatorsTeam! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.
```

</Steps>
Your computer is now setup and ready to start commit'ing.
