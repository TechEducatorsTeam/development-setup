# Configure Git, and connect to a VCS provider

Throughout the course we will be using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to keep
track of our work and publishing it to a VCS provider. During the course we
will use Github - a free VCS provider owned by Microsoft. Don't worry, we'll
give you an introduction into how to use it and will concentrate on getting
setup and configured today.

Git comes preinstalled on Ubuntu, so you won't need to install it. So let's get
it configured.

## Register for GitHub

First, we'll need to register an account with Github -
[https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

## Configure Git locally

Now open your Terminal, or on Windows the Ubuntu App, and type the following
(make sure to complete your details where required):

```sh copy
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
```

```sh copy
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Make sure `'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'` in the command above matches the one you're
  using with GitHub.
</Callout>

```sh copy
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Generate your SSH keys

Now, we'll create credentials for your git client and provide these to GitHub.
We'll generate a pair of "[SSH Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)"
We refer to one as your public key, and the other as your private key.

First, let's generate your new keys; at your terminal please type:

```sh copy
ssh-keygen
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  You will be asked for a file name, unless you already have keys you can ignore
  and just tap enter to every option.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  You will be asked for a passphrase, we recommend leaving this empty and
  instead ensure you keep the private key safe.
</Callout>

You should see a similar output in your terminal as below:

```txt {5-6}
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:sk4MR4/BBLy2cXd0fSKqQdjqSfkVkQjz+NLSXyE+sy0 username@Computer-Host-Name
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   ...++ ..o .   |
|    .o.++ + o o .|
|     .=+...+.. o |
|    +.=Bo.+. .   |
|   ..**+S=+ .    |
|    .+o=o. *     |
|      +   E .    |
|     o     .     |
|      .          |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

This has created a public and private key in the `/home/username/.ssh`
directory. The private key is called `id_rsa` (or `id_ed25519`) & the public key is called `id_rsa.pub` (or `id_ed25519.pub`). Keep the private key safe. We can now share our public key with GitHub or another provider. First let's
print out it's contents:

If your ssh-keygen generated the file "id_rsa.pub" :

```sh copy
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

If you ssh-keygen generated the file "id_ed25519.pub" :

```sh copy
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

You should see a similar output in your terminal as below:

```sh wrap
ssh-rsa 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 username@Computer-Host-Name
```

or

```sh wrap

```

Copy this output and add it to your GitHub SSH Keys,
[Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)
The key's title is for your own benefit, allowing you to easily identify
different keys; we recommend naming it after your computer and generating new
keys on each device you use:

![Add your SSH keys to GitHub](/github--ssh-keys.jpg)

## Confirm it's setup

Now, we can confirm this has worked by asking GitHub who it thinks you are:

```sh copy
ssh git@github.com
```

You will be asked to confirm the authenticity, simply type yes, and you should
see a message confirming "You've successfully authenticated":

```
The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.3)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

```

```
Hi TechEducatorsTeam! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.
