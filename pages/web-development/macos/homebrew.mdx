# Installing Homebrew

Homebrew cites itself as the missing package manager for MacOS. This is a third
party application to ease in the installation of software on your MacOS system.

Open your terminal and run the following:

```sh copy
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once this has been completed, the install will suggest a few extra steps. These
are very important and we repeat them here to be sure:

```sh copy
echo 'eval "$(`which brew` shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

```sh copy
source .zshrc
```

You can confirm brew is installed correctly by running it's `doctor` command:

```sh copy
brew doctor
```

## Installing additional tools

We'll install some basic tools to help during the course:

```sh copy
brew install tree
```

## Installing oh-my-zsh

```sh copy
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
