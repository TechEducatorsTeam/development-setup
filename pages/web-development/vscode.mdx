## Configuring VSCode & Extensions

### General settings

These are optional changes however they may make your life a little more comfortable so do consider them.

Press either `CMD + ,` on mac or `Ctrl + ,` on Windows and Linux to open settings.

Once open, go to the search bar at the top to find and edit settings.

- Search for ‘wrap’ and turn it on to prevent side scrolling.
- Search for ‘tree indent’ and increase the number to create bigger indents on the file tree. We recommend doubling it to 16.
- Search for ‘compact folder’ and turn this off to create a more legible view of empty folders inside empty folders.

### Configuring VSCode for the Prettier extension

Prettier is well configured out the box however we need to update a couple of settings to make Prettier work with ease. We will be editing settings again so press either `CMD +  ,` on mac or `Ctrl + ,` on Windows & Linux to open settings. Once open, go to the search bar at the top to find and edit settings.

- Search ‘Default Formatter’ and change it to ‘Prettier - Code formatter’.
- Search ‘Format On Save’ and ensure it is ticked.

Once you have done this, your code will be automatically formatted for you when you manually save your document (this won’t kick in with autosave).

## Customising VSCode with Themes & Icons

Now who doesn’t like customising something with the theme of their choice? VSCode has a very large number of themes and many opinions on which theme is best, the truth is that the best theme is the one that you like the most.

That said, here are some of our favourites

- Dark+ (this is what the instructors use, it's one of the default themes, nothing to install)
- [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple)
- [Synthwave](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)
- [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula)

As for icons, well there aren’t a huge number of icon packs but the two most popular are [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons) and [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)

But by all means, checkout the [extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Rating) and pick your favourite.
