# Install Node.js with Node Version Manager (aka NVM)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a powerful and popular open-source runtime
environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web
browser.

It's vast ecosystem of modules and libraries, make it versatile for a wide
range of applications, including server-side web development, network
applications, real-time chat applications, and more.

We'll use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and
manage Node.js for us. Let's get started:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Install NVM

Let's download and install nvm

```sh copy
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash
```

This will have installed nvm, but to get started using it in the terminal
we're currently using we can source our zsh config with the following command

```sh copy
source ~/.zshrc
```

We now have nvm setup, and can install a Node.js version of our choosing.

### Step 2: Install Node.js 22.14

At the time of writing, the LTS version is 22.14. We're going to use nvm now to
get that installed:

```sh copy
nvm install 22
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Downloading and installing node v22.x.x...
Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.x.x/node-v22.x.x-linux-x64.tar.xz...
################################################################################################################# 100.0%
Computing checksum with sha256sum
Checksums matched!
Now using node v22.x.x (npm v11.3.0)
Creating default alias: default -> 22 (-> v22.x.x)
```

Now, if you type `node --version` you will see something like `v22.11.1` confirming it's setup
and you're ready to start building web applications ðŸŽ‰.
