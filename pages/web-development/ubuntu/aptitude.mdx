# Installing & Updating OS software

For some things on your system, we will be using Advanced Package Tool,
referred to as apt, to install applications. The first thing weâ€™ll want to do
is make sure we're up to date, and then we'll get some basic packages installed

Open your terminal emulator, or if you're on Windows this will be your Ubuntu
App. Type the following commands into the window:

```sh copy
sudo apt update
```

```sh copy
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Now we'll install a few OS packages:

```sh copy
sudo apt install -y build-essential tree zsh
```

## Installing oh-my-zsh

```sh copy
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## ChromeOS Linux

If you are using a ChromeOS Linux you will also need to install DNS Utilities

```sh copy
sudo apt install dnsutils
```
